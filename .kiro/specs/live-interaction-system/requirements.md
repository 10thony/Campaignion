# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Live Interaction System is a real-time multiplayer feature that enables D&D 5e players and Dungeon Masters to conduct live interactive sessions (combat, social encounters, puzzles) with synchronized state management, turn-based gameplay, and real-time communication. This system operates as a separate containerized service alongside the existing CRUD campaign management application, connected through the interactions list component where users can join interactions and DMs can manage interaction states.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-Time Session Management

**User Story:** As a Dungeon Master, I want to create and manage live interaction sessions so that I can run real-time D&D encounters with my players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DM creates an interaction in the CRUD app THEN the system SHALL make it available for live play through the interactions list component
2. WHEN a DM sets an interaction to "live" status THEN the tRPC server SHALL create an in-memory room with the interaction's initial state
3. WHEN an interaction goes live THEN all participants SHALL receive notifications and be able to join the session
4. WHEN a DM pauses an interaction THEN the system SHALL save a full state snapshot to Convex and maintain the room for resumption
5. WHEN a DM completes an interaction THEN the system SHALL finalize all state data, save outcomes to Convex, and clean up the in-memory room
6. WHEN a room is inactive for the configured timeout period THEN the system SHALL automatically save state to Convex and clear memory

### Requirement 2: Turn-Based Gameplay System

**User Story:** As a player, I want to take turns in a structured order during live interactions so that gameplay follows D&D 5e turn-based mechanics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an interaction begins THEN the system SHALL establish an initiative order for all participants
2. WHEN it's a player's turn THEN they SHALL have 90 seconds to complete their actions before being automatically skipped
3. WHEN a player takes an action THEN the system SHALL validate the action against game rules, inventory, and map constraints
4. WHEN a turn is completed THEN the system SHALL advance to the next participant in initiative order
5. WHEN all participants have acted in a round THEN the system SHALL save a full state snapshot to Convex
6. WHEN a DM needs to control NPC/monster turns THEN they SHALL be able to queue and execute actions for non-player entities
7. WHEN a DM needs to modify turn order THEN they SHALL be able to skip, backtrack, or override turns with confirmation

### Requirement 3: Real-Time State Synchronization

**User Story:** As a participant in a live interaction, I want all game state changes to be immediately visible to other participants so that everyone stays synchronized during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any game state changes occur THEN the system SHALL broadcast delta updates to all connected participants
2. WHEN a participant joins a live interaction THEN they SHALL receive the current complete game state
3. WHEN a participant disconnects and reconnects THEN they SHALL receive state updates to synchronize with the current game state
4. WHEN simultaneous actions are attempted for the same entity THEN the system SHALL accept the first action and reject subsequent ones
5. WHEN the server needs to maintain state consistency THEN it SHALL use the in-memory state as the active source of truth during live play
6. WHEN state persistence is required THEN the system SHALL save complete snapshots to Convex at defined trigger points

### Requirement 4: Player Interaction Interface

**User Story:** As a player, I want an intuitive interface during live interactions so that I can easily perform actions, communicate, and track game progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a live interaction begins THEN players SHALL see a modal interface with their character's available actions, inventory, and game state
2. WHEN it's a player's turn THEN they SHALL see highlighted available actions, movement options, and valid targets
3. WHEN a player selects an action THEN they SHALL be able to specify targets, movement, and item usage through the interface
4. WHEN players need to communicate THEN they SHALL have access to party chat, DM chat, and private messaging
5. WHEN players need to track game progress THEN they SHALL see the current initiative order, turn history, and map state
6. WHEN a player needs to use items THEN they SHALL be able to equip, unequip, and consume items from their inventory during their turn

### Requirement 5: Dungeon Master Controls

**User Story:** As a Dungeon Master, I want comprehensive control tools during live interactions so that I can effectively manage the game session and handle edge cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DM needs to manage initiative THEN they SHALL be able to auto-roll initiative for all participants at session start
2. WHEN a DM controls NPCs or monsters THEN they SHALL be able to take turns for these entities with the same action validation as players
3. WHEN a DM needs to correct gameplay THEN they SHALL be able to roll back turns and allow players to redo actions
4. WHEN a DM needs to handle disconnected players THEN they SHALL be able to skip turns for offline participants
5. WHEN a DM needs to target multiple entities THEN they SHALL have multi-target selection capabilities for area effects
6. WHEN a DM needs to override game rules THEN they SHALL have administrative controls to modify state when necessary
7. WHEN a DM needs to view game history THEN they SHALL have access to complete turn logs and action history

### Requirement 6: Connection and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a participant, I want the system to handle network issues and disconnections gracefully so that temporary connectivity problems don't disrupt the game session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player disconnects THEN the system SHALL notify other participants and allow the DM to skip their turns
2. WHEN a player reconnects THEN they SHALL be able to rejoin the session and take any missed turns
3. WHEN a DM disconnects THEN the system SHALL pause the interaction and save state while allowing players to queue actions
4. WHEN the DM reconnects THEN they SHALL be able to resume the paused interaction from the saved state
5. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection and state synchronization
6. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors to Convex and attempt graceful degradation
7. WHEN state conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL prioritize server state and update clients accordingly

### Requirement 7: Security and Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all user actions to be properly authenticated and validated so that the game maintains integrity and prevents cheating.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users attempt to join interactions THEN the system SHALL authenticate them via Clerk tokens
2. WHEN players attempt actions THEN the system SHALL validate they can only control their own characters
3. WHEN any action is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate it against game rules, character abilities, and current state
4. WHEN DMs perform administrative actions THEN the system SHALL verify their DM role for the specific campaign
5. WHEN state changes are requested THEN the system SHALL ensure all modifications follow the established game rules
6. WHEN users access the live system THEN all communications SHALL be encrypted and secure

### Requirement 8: Integration with CRUD Application

**User Story:** As a user of the campaign management system, I want seamless integration between the CRUD application and live interactions so that I can easily transition between campaign management and live play.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interactions are created in the CRUD app THEN they SHALL be available in the interactions list component for live play
2. WHEN a DM changes interaction status in the interactions list THEN the live system SHALL respond appropriately (start, pause, complete)
3. WHEN live interactions conclude THEN all outcomes, logs, and state changes SHALL be persisted back to the CRUD application's Convex database
4. WHEN users view the interactions list THEN they SHALL see real-time status updates for live interactions
5. WHEN character data is needed for live play THEN the system SHALL fetch current character information from the CRUD application
6. WHEN live interactions affect character progression THEN updates SHALL be synchronized back to the CRUD application

### Requirement 9: Accessibility and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the live interaction system to be fully accessible so that I can participate in D&D sessions regardless of my assistive technology requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the live system THEN all UI components SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple interactions run simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain performance without degradation
2. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN it SHALL be horizontally scalable through containerization
3. WHEN state updates occur THEN they SHALL be transmitted efficiently using delta updates rather than full state broadcasts
4. WHEN rooms are inactive THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up memory to optimize resource usage
5. WHEN the system needs to persist data THEN it SHALL do so efficiently without blocking real-time operations
6. WHEN monitoring system health THEN performance metrics SHALL be available for operational oversight
